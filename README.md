# Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)
Write a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade as follows: 

A > 79, B > 60 to 79, C > 59 to 49, D > 40 to 49, E > less 40.
# challenge 1 setup
for this challenge i used the if else statement to grade the students according to how they had performed.
i also created a  table containing the various students along with the marks they had scored together with the grades they had attained.
 

## Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)
Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.
## challenge 2 setup
in this challenge i used the if else statement to evaluate the speed of the drivers,then i also issued demerit points to the drivers who exceeded the issued speed limit. for the drivers who had more tha 12 demerit points had their license revocked.
